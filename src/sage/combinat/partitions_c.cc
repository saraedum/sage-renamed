 *      This program computes p(n), the number of integer partitions of n, using Rademacher's
 *      formula. (See Hans Rademacher, On the Partition Function p(n),
 *      Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society 1938 s2-43(4):241-254; doi:10.1112/plms/s2-43.4.241,
 *      currently at
 *
 *      http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/s2-43/4/241
 *
 *      if you have access.)
 *
 *      We use the following notation:
 *
 *      p(n) = lim_{n --> oo} t(n,N)
 *
 *      where
 *
 *      t(n,N) = sum_{k=1}^N a(n,k) f_n(k),
 *
 *      where
 *
 *      a(n,k) = sum_{h=1, (h,k) = 1}^k exp(\pi i s(h,k) - 2 \pi i h  n / k)
 *
 *      and
 *
 *      f_n(k) = \pi sqrt{2} cosh(A_n/(sqrt{3}*k))/(B_n*k) - sinh(C_n/k)/D_n;
 *
 *      where
 *
 *      s(h,k) = \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}(j/k)((hj/k))
 *
 *      A_n = sqrt{2} \pi * sqrt{n - 1/24}
 *      B_n = 2 * sqrt{3} * (n - 1/24)
 *      C_n = sqrt{2} * \pi * sqrt{n - 1.0/24.0} / sqrt{3}
 *      D_n = 2 * (n - 1/24) * sqrt{n - 1.0/24.0}
 *
 *      and, finally, where ((x)) is the sawtooth function ((x)) = {x} - 1/2 if x is not an integer, 0 otherwise.
 *
 *      Some clever tricks are used in the computation of s(h,k), and perhaps at least
 *      some of these are due to Apostol. (I don't know a reference for this.)

 *      I looked source code written by Ralf Stephan, currently available at
 *
 *              http://www.ark.in-berlin.de/part.c
 *
 *      while writing this code, but didn't really make use of it.
 *      Maybe we could use the function cospi() instead of mpfr_cos()
 *      but there seems to be no gain in doing that.
 *
 *      More useful were notes currently available at

 *      mailing list.
